[Link to Blog Post that covers the details of this Dashboard and View](https://www.vcrocs.info/vcommunity-mp-windows-servers-services/)

I created one Dashboard and One View to share. More to come...

You **must** have the **vCommunity MP** installed to use this **Dashboard** and **View**.  

You also **must** add the service names to the `windows_service_list.xml` file using the **Management Packs Configuration**.
