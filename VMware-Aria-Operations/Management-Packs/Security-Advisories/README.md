## Key Files in the Repository for Broadcom Security Advisories

In this repository, there are three essential files youâ€™ll want to be familiar with:

- **Broadcom Security Advisories-1.0.1.6.pak**  
  This is the Broadcom Security Advisories Management Pack (MP) file that can be imported into VCF Operations.

- **DBH VCF Security Advisories View.zip**  
  This file contains the view I used with the Dashboard. You can add Dashboard files to an MPB, but views are not directly included in MPB.

- **Broadcom Security Advisories.json**  
  This file is a great resource for learning how the Management Pack Builder (MPB) works. I recommend importing this file into MPB as a starting point.

The goal of this repository is to help people understand how to use the Management Pack Builder. The Broadcom Security Advisories is a simple use case to get started with.
