# vCenter Tag Management Using Excel

I was asked if an Excel spreadsheet could serve as the source of truth for managing tags within vCenter. This use case involves two files: a PowerShell script and an Excel (.xlsx) file.

### Files:
- `vCenter-TAG-Using-Excel.ps1`
- `vCenter-Tags.xlsx`

With some modifications to the script, it would be possible to list the VM names and the corresponding tags that should be applied.
